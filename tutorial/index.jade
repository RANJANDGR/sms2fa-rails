    ## About this Application

    This [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) application example
    demonstrates how to implement an SMS two-factor authentication using Twilio.

    _To run this application yourself [download the code and follow the
    instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/sms2fa-rails)._

    Adding two-factor authentication (2FA) to your web application increases the
    security of your user's data. [Multi-factor
    authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication)
    determines the identity of a user in two steps: 

    1. First we validate the user with an email and password

    2. Second, we validate using a mobile device, by sending them a one-time **verification code**.

    Once our user enters the verification code, we know they have received the SMS, and indeed are who they say they are. This is a standard SMS implementation.

    For a slightly more advanced implementation using [Authy](https://www.twilio.com/authy) One-Touch checkout this [tutorial](/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/two-factor-authentication/ruby/rails).

    Let's get started!

    ## Generating a Verification Code

    Once our user logs in we need to send them a _verification code_.

    To generate our _verification code_ we use `Random#rand` which can take a
    _range_ as an argument. Considering the current implementation our _6-digit
    verification code_ could be any number between **100000** and **999999**.

    Next let's look at how we would send this in an SMS with Twilio.

    ## Sending a Verification Code

    The Twilio helper library allows us to easily send an SMS.

    First we have to create an instance of a **Twilio Client** with our
    credentials. Now all we have to do to send an SMS using the REST API is to call `client.messages.create()` with the necessary parameters.

    You can find your credentials at your [Twilio Account](//www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming).

    ## Registering a User

    When a **user** signs up for our website, this controller creates the **user** and sends them a _verification code_.

    In order to do two-factor authentication we need to make sure we ask for the
    user's **phone number**.

    Let's see how we implemented the `send_confirmation_to` method.

    ## Putting It All Together

    Using the building blocks we've created in the previous steps we can now pull it all together.

    Notice we update the user with the _verification code_ since we'll need to look it up to verify the user.

    Let's take a look on how to implement the actual 2-Step verification.

  :markdown
    ## Implementing the 2-Step Verification

    When the **user** receives an SMS with the _verification code_ we need to
    ensure the given code is valid.

    This validation is achieved by comparing the user's **verification code**
    with the _verification code_ the user inputs on the form.

    ![Confirm Verification Code](http://howtodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/sms-2fa-authentication.png)

    If the validation was successful the application allows the user to have
    access to the protected content. Otherwise the application will prompt for
    the _verification code_ once again.
